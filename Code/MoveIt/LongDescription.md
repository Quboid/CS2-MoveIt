# Move It Beta for Cities Skylines 2.

This is the unstable beta version and may have unexpected issues. Please report any in the forum or on Discord.

Stable version:
https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74324/Windows


You can move trees, props, decals, buildings, surfaces, nodes, and segment curves.

Press M or click on the Move It icon at the bottom right to enable the tool.


## Selecting:

Left-click to select, shift+click on unselected object to add to selection or on selected object to remove from selection. Press Control+M or check options to toggle Marquee mode; when enabled you can drag out a rectangle to select multiple objects. Right-click to clear selection and hide all control points.


## Mode Icons:
* Single Selection - Click on individual objects to select, shift+click to add an unselected object or to remove a selected object.
* Marquee Selection - Left+Click and drag to draw out a selection box. Single Selection clicks can also be used.
* Manipulation Mode - Alter aspects within an object.


## Moving:

Left-click drag to move selection, right-click drag to rotate selection. Alt+right-click drag to rotate in 45 degree increments.

While reshaping a single segment, drag to the mid-point between the nodes and hold Alt to snap to straight.


## Manipulation:

To enter manipulation mode, click on the icon, press Alt+M, or Alt+click on a manipulatable object. To leave, choose a different mode, press Alt+M, or right-click with nothing selected to leave manipulation mode. For now, only segments can be manipulated.

Manipulating segments - you can move the control points in all three axis; the 2 node connections and the 2 curve points. This is very powerful, and extreme alterations will cause visual glitching and may break traffic routing. Control Points snap along their visible line. Also, for node connections drag to the node and hold Alt to snap to the node's position, and for curve points, drag to a third of the way between the segment's two nodes and hold Alt to snap it to a straight line.


## Default Keys:
* M - open or close tool (you must unbind the vanilla binding for M)
* Control+M - Toggle Marquee selection
* Alt+M - Toggle Manipulation mode
* Alt+D - Deselect all
* Page Up/Down - move selected objects vertically
* Numpad 9/3 - move selected objects vertically, including in editor
* Control+Z - Undo
* Control+Shift+Z - Redo
* Hold Alt - Snap rotation to 45 degrees, snap segments as described above.


## Options:
* Invert Rotation - Move It uses the same rotation direction that Cities 1 and Move It for Cities 1 used. If you prefer Cities 2's direction, you can invert it.
* Show Debug Panel - Show some technical information about Move It's current status. You probably don't want this.
* Extended Debug Logging - Saves more information to the log file to help me hunt down errors.
* Save Logs To Desktop - Saves your current log files to your desktop so you can easily submit them with bug reports. You can also do this with Skyve.
* Advanced: Hide Move It Icon - If the icon is causing crashing issues and nothing else helps, enable this to hide the icon.
* Advanced: Show Debug Lines - Displays some debugging data.

This is an beta version of Move It. Save often, save different.
