# Move It Alpha for Cities Skylines 2.

You can move trees, props, buildings, nodes, and segment curves.

Press M or click on the Move It icon at the bottom right to enable the tool.


## Selecting:

Left-click to select, shift+click on unselected object to add to selection or on selected object to remove from selection. Press Control+M or check options to toggle Marquee mode; when enabled you can drag out a rectangle to select multiple objects. Right-click to clear selection and hide all control points.


## Moving:

Left-click drag to move selection, right-click drag to rotate selection. Alt+right-click drag to rotate in 45 degree increments.

While reshaping a single segment, drag to the mid-point between the nodes and hold Alt to snap to straight.

## Manipulation:

Manipulation mode lets you alter aspects within an object.

To enter manipulation mode, press Alt+M or Alt+click on a manipulatable object. Press Alt+M or right-click to leave manipulation mode. For now, only segments can be manipulated.

Manipulating segments - you can move the control points in all three axis; the 2 node connections and the 2 curve points. This is very powerful, and extreme alterations will cause visual glitching and may break traffic routing. Control Points snap along their visible line. Also, for node connections drag to the node and hold Alt to snap to the node's position, and for curve points, drag to a third of the way between the segment's two nodes and hold Alt to snap it to a straight line.


## Keys:
* M - open or close tool (you must unbind the vanilla binding for M)
* Control+M - Toggle Marquee selection
* Alt+M - Toggle Manipulation mode
* Alt+D - Unselect all
* Page Up/Down - move selected objects vertically
* Control+Z - Undo
* Control+Shift+Z - Redo
* Hold Alt - Snap rotation to 45 degrees, snap segments as described above.


## Known Issues:

* Forcing an antialiasing mode that isn't supported by CS2 can cause the overlays to disappear. Do not use TAA.
* The M key is set to a fairly unimportant infoview by default, you should remove this.
* There are performance issues particularly with very large selections.
* Selection overlays may be invisible on raised networks.

This is an alpha version of Move It. Save often, save different.
